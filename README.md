# Author Post Widget

### This plugin generates a widget that displays in any widgets area in WordPress the author of the entry or page.

In this way, instead of using the author's display predefined by WordPress, we can choose to place it where we want without touching the source code of our theme.


## Instalation guide

- Clone or download this repository
- Once you have it, save it all in a folder with the name: author-post-widget
- Compress the folder in .zip format
- Go to the WordPress Dashboard> Plugins> Add new> Upload plugin
- Activate the plugin
- Go to the widget section and add it to the widgets area where you want it to be displayed


### Notes

- It is not necessary to "Save", it is fully functional since it is placed in the widgets area
- The plugin was developed in an environment for the GutenType theme but it should work without problems with any other theme
